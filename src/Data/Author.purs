-- This is a reasonably nested type, so we'll likely want to easily recover parts
-- of the type like a profile, username, or avatar. We can do that by defining a
-- few prisms (an optic for values that may or may not exist).
--
-- For example, to retrieve a profile of a followed user, we could write:
--
-- getFollowedProfile :: Author -> Maybe Profile
-- getFollowedProfile = preview (_Newtype >>> _Following)

  _ -> Nothing

_You :: Prism' Author Profile
_You  = prism' You case _ of
  You prof -> Just prof
  _ -> Nothing

-- We'll write a manual decoder instead of a decode instance so that we can test
-- if the current user is the same as the one received in the object.

-- We can use our prisms and lenses to drill down any particular pathway in the

-- no matter where in the structure we have to get it from.
