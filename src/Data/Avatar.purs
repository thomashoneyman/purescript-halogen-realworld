-- | Avatars are strings representing URL locations of images. It's useful to be able to tell at

-- | operations on the type that shouldn't be allowed (string functions). In fact, this should be
-- | a largely read-only type in our application, so we'll use the smart constructor pattern to
-- | restrict how values of this type can be created and manipulated.

-- | Avatars are strings representing URL locations of images, and we'll use the `Avatar` type to
-- | distinguish them from usual strings. We'll restrict the type so that not any old string can
-- | be an avatar: they'll have to pass our `parse` validation first.
-- |
-- | Not all users have an avatar, which we'll represent with  the correct type: `Maybe Avatar`.

-- | Ordinarily we'd define this using `wrapIso Avatar CA.string`, but here we don't actually have
-- | a newtype instance. Instead, we'll explicitly provide to / from functions to the prismaticCodec
-- | function.
codec :: JsonCodec Avatar
codec = CA.prismaticCodec parse toString CA.string

-- | While not all users have an avatar, if the `Avatar` type is being used, then we should be
-- | confident there's actually a URL location inside. We won't validate the URLs (though we could!)
-- | but we *will* verify non-emptiness.
parse :: String -> Maybe Avatar
parse "" = Nothing
parse str = Just (Avatar str)

-- | Since we haven't exported the `Avatar` constructor, we'll include this small function so you
-- | can recover a string from the type.
toString :: Avatar -> String
toString (Avatar str) = str

-- | Avatars are optional, but we don't want to display broken images on our site. This function
-- | provides a fallback avatar for when a user doesn't have one.
