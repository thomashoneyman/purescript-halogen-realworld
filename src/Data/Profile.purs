-- | Profiles are an example of an entity (a persistent data type with a unique identity) and are
-- | widely used in the Conduit application.
-- |
-- | We have two versions of the `Profile` type, as with the `Article` type: one with a few core
-- | fields about the user and another that also contains their email address. It's tedious and
-- | error-prone to write out multiple variations of a type which all share the same core fields
-- | so we'll use extensible to solve that problem.
-- |
-- | The backend returns a `following` flag as part of a profile, but this can lead to invalid
-- | states. What happens if you're viewing your own profile? There's no concept of following
-- | yourself. We'll create a custom type to rule out invalid relationships like this.
-- |
-- | This module also demonstrates how to create lenses for record types. Optics, which include
-- | lenses, let you work with values within nested structures. We'll use optics to drill down from
-- | large types like a component `State` to a particular field in a profile stored in that state.

-- | Let's start by defining a small helper data type before we move on to the larger `Profile` type.
-- |
-- | As far as our JSON is concerned, a user profile includes a username, avatar, biography, and
-- | a unique field: whether the currently-authenticated user is following this profile. This
-- | value is true only when there is a current user and they follow the profile in question.
-- | If there is no current user, or the requested profile belongs to the current user, or the
-- | current user isn't following the requested profile, then the value is `false`.
-- |
-- | Unfortunately, this tricky true/false flag can lead to invalid states in our UI. For example,
-- | user profiles in the application can have a follow button on them. If you don't follow the user
-- | then clicking this button should send a `followUser` request. If you do follow the user, then
-- | it should send an `unfollowUser` request. And if you're viewing your own profile, there should
-- | be no button at all.
-- |
-- | We need a better type: one that represents the *three* possibilities for how a given profile
-- | relates to the (possible) current user. The `Relation` type captures these three cases nicely.

  = Following
  | NotFollowing

derive instance eqRelation :: Eq Relation

-- | Now, let's describe the fields of our main `Profile` type, which should also be shared with
-- | the extended `ProfileWithEmail` type.
-- |
-- | A user profile contains a mandatory username, a biography which is allowed to be empty, an
-- | optional avatar, and a relation to the current user, if there is one. We've already designed
-- | types that nicely capture the semantics of each field, so all we need to do here is assemble
-- | them into a row that can be used to implement `Profile` and `ProfileWithEmail`.
type ProfileRep row =
  ( username :: Username
  , bio :: Maybe String
  , image :: Maybe Avatar
  | row
  )

-- | The `Profile` type consists only of three core fields: the username, biography, and avatar.
type Profile = { | ProfileRep () }

-- | The `ProfileWithEmail` type extends the `Profile` fields with an additional `Email` type.
type ProfileWithEmail = { | ProfileRep (email :: Email) }

-- | The `ProfileWithEmail` type extends the `Profile` fields with an additional `Email` type.
type ProfileWithEmailPassword = { | ProfileRep (email :: Email, password :: Maybe String) }

-- | The `Author` type extends the `Profile` fields with an additional `Relation` type.
