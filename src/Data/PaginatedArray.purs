module Conduit.Data.PaginatedArray where

-- | This type is a simple model of paginated data. We don't receive an entire payload at once, so
-- | it's unnecessary to track anything beyond our current window of data. We'll hold on to the 
-- | total so we can tell how many pages to render in a clickable list in the dashboard, among 
-- | others.
-- |
-- | Since all the members of this record type have `DecodeJSON` instances, we don't have to write 
-- | any manual encoding or decoding! This can be translated to and from JSON with no additional
-- | effort on our part.
