-- We'll represent routes in our application with a simple sum type. As the 
-- application grows, you might want to swap this out with an extensible sum 
-- type with `Variant` and have several sub-sections. For our small MVP this 
-- type will work just fine and will prevent us from trying to send users to 
-- non-existent routes. These routes are taken from the frontend spec.

-- Next, we'll define a bidirectional codec for our route parsing. Our single
-- codec will handle both parsing browser locations and serializing our data type
-- to a browser location. We'll skip the boilerplate of separate encoding and
-- decoding functions, and we'll ensure our parsing and printing is always in sync.

-- Our codec will cause a compile-time error if we fail to handle any of our 
-- route cases.
