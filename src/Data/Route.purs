-- | We can represent valid locations in our application with a simple sum type. This will cause
-- | any invalid routes to fail at compile-time. 
-- |
-- | But since the browser represents locations with strings, we'll also need a way to write our 
-- | `Route` type to a string and parse strings into valid `Route` values. It's tedious and error-
-- | prone to maintain separate printing and parsing functions which can fall out of sync with 
-- | another, and even worse to write them manually. Fortunately, the `routing-duplex` library will
-- | help us write a bi-directional codec which solves both problems.

-- | We'll represent routes in our application with a simple sum type. As the application grows, 
-- | you might want to swap this out with an extensible sum type with `Variant` and have several 
-- | sub-sections. For our small MVP this type will work just fine and will prevent us from trying 
-- | to send users to non-existent routes.
data Route
  = Home
  | Login
  | Register
  | Settings
  | Editor
  | EditArticle Slug
  | ViewArticle Slug

-- | Next, we'll define a bidirectional codec for our route parsing. Our single codec will handle 
-- | both parsing browser locations and serializing our data type to a browser location. We'll skip 
-- | the boilerplate of separate encoding and decoding functions, and we'll ensure our parsing and 
-- | printing is always in sync.
-- | 
-- | Our codec will cause a compile-time error if we fail to handle any of our route cases.
