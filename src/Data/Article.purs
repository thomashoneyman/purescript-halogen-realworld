-- | Articles are an example of an entity (a persistent data type with a unique identity). They're
-- | a critical, widely-used type in Conduit.
-- |
-- | We have two versions of the `Article` type: one with just some base fields and another with
-- | the same fields, but also a bunch of metadata that is only sometimes included in the data
-- | we get from the server.
-- |
-- | It's tedious and error-prone to define multiple variations of a type which can have fields
-- | that are only sometimes present. To avoid this, we'll use PureScript's lovely extensible
-- | rows & records. I've given a *much* fuller treatment of the topic in the `Conduit.Api.Request`
-- | module. If you stil feel unfamiliar with this pattern, I recommend giving that module a read
-- | before coming back to this one.

-- | First, we'll describe the core fields that are always present when we have an `Article`. In
-- | general these fields can be edited by users and have few-to-no restrictions on the type. Just
-- | about any string will do, according to the spec.
type ArticleRep row =
  ( title :: String
  , description :: String
  , body :: String
  , tagList :: Array String
  | row
  )

-- | Next, we'll define another row containing the additional metadata which is sometimes included
-- | with an article. These types are not generally editable by users and have crisper types. For
-- | example, we expect a well-formed slug (not any string will do!), a precise datetime value,
-- | and a custom `Profile` type. The `Profile` type is interesting because it disallows some tricky
-- | invalid states in the type system. It's defined in `Conduit.Data.Profile`.
type ArticleMetadataRep row =
  ( slug :: Slug
  , createdAt :: PreciseDateTime
  , favorited :: Boolean
  , favoritesCount :: Int
  , author :: Author
  | row
  )

-- | The prior types were both rows, which are type-level lists. We can't actually construct a
-- | value-level row! Instead, we'll create records, which are similar to objects or dictionaries
-- | in other languages.
-- |
-- | Our article type will be a record containing only the core row. Our extended article type,
-- | `ArticleWithMetadat`, will include all the fields from the core row, plus all the fields from
-- | the metadat row.
