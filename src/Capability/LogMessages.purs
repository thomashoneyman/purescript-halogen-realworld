-- | A capability representing the ability to save status information to some output, which could 
-- | be the console, an external service like Splunk, or to the file system for testing purposes. 
-- | The implementation can be freely swapped out without changing any application code besides 
-- | the application monad, `Conduit.AppM`.
-- |
-- | To learn more about why we use capabilities and this architecture, please see the guide:

module Conduit.Capability.LogMessages where

import Prelude

import Conduit.Capability.Now (class Now)
import Conduit.Data.Log (Log, LogReason(..), mkLog)

-- | We require a strict format for the messages that we log so that we can search this structured 
-- | data from our logging service later on. We can enforce this with the type system by using the 
-- | `Log` type from `Conduit.Data.Log`. This type can only be constructed using helper functions
-- | in that module, which enforce the correct format. However, we'll leave it up to the implementer
-- | to decide what to do with the log once created. 
class Monad m <= LogMessages m where
  logMessage :: Log -> m Unit

-- | This instance lets us avoid having to use `lift` when we use these functions in a component.
instance logMessagesHalogenM :: LogMessages m => LogMessages (HalogenM s f g p o m) where
  logMessage = lift <<< logMessage

-- | Next, we'll provide a few helper functions to help users easily create and dispatch logs
-- | from anywhere in the application. Each helper composes a couple of small functions together
-- | so that we've got less to remember later on.

-- | Log a message to convey non-error information

-- | Log a message as a warning

logWarn = log Warn 

-- | Log a message as an error
logError :: forall m. LogMessages m => Now m => String -> m Unit
