-- | A capability representing the ability to manage tags in our system, which only includes 
-- | fetching all tags in the system.
-- | 
-- | This capability lets us ignore the mechanics of managing a resource and focus on our
-- | business logic. For now our app implements this capability with a REST API, but we could 
-- | easily swap in a database, RPC, local filesystem, or something else without having to touch 
-- | any application code besides the application monad, `Conduit.AppM`. In addition, we can test 
-- | our business logic  by mocking responses in our test monad instead of hitting the server.
-- |
-- | To learn more about why we use capabilities and this architecture, please see the guide:

module Conduit.Capability.Resource.Tag where

import Prelude

import Data.Maybe (Maybe)
import Halogen (HalogenM, lift)

-- | This capability represents the ability to manage tags in our system. Currently we only
-- | need to get all tags.
-- | 
-- | We'll handle all the mechanics of making the request, decoding responses, handling errors, and 
-- | so on in the implementation.
class Monad m <= ManageTag m where
  getAllTags :: m (Maybe (Array String))

-- | This instance lets us avoid having to use `lift` when we use these functions in a component.
instance manageTagHalogenM :: ManageTag m => ManageTag (HalogenM s f g p o m) where
  getAllTags = lift getAllTags
