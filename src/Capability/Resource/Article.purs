-- | A capability representing the ability to manage articles in our system, which includes 
-- | creation, deletion, updates, favoriting, getting the user feed, and so on. 
-- | 
-- | This capability lets us ignore the mechanics of managing a resource and focus on our
-- | business logic. For now our app implements this capability with a REST API, but we could 
-- | easily swap in a database, RPC, local filesystem, or something else without having to touch 
-- | any application code besides the application monad, `Conduit.AppM`. In addition, we can test 
-- | our business logic  by mocking responses in our test monad instead of hitting the server.
-- |
-- | To learn more about why we use capabilities and this architecture, please see the guide:

-- | This capability represents the ability to manage articles in our system. Each function 
-- | represents a simple process to read, write, update, delete, favorite, or take some other action 
-- | on an article (or articles). 
-- |
-- | We'll handle all the mechanics of making the request, decoding responses, handling errors, and 
-- | so on in the implementation.
