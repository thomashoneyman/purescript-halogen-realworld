-- | A capability representing the ability to fetch the current time. This is pure, so we can

import Prelude

import Control.Monad.Trans.Class (lift)
import Data.DateTime (Date, DateTime, Time)
import Data.DateTime.Instant (Instant)
import Halogen (HalogenM)

-- | This class may seem trivial as these are all functions available from the  `purescript-now` 
-- | package. But by making a capability we can freely swap out implementations without breaking 
-- | existing code. For example, our production monad can use the `Effect` functions from the 
-- | `purescript-now` modules directly, whereas our test monad can return a hard-coded instant,
-- | date, time, or datetime so our tests can be deterministic. That way we can write our business
-- | logic once and use the exact same code in our tests and in production.
class Monad m <= Now m where
  now :: m Instant
  nowDate :: m Date
  nowTime :: m Time
  nowDateTime :: m DateTime

-- | This instance lets us avoid having to use `lift` when we use these functions in a component.
