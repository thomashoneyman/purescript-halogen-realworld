-- | The follow buttons in Conduit don't have enough encapsulated state or behaviors to be a full

-- | same query handler over and over again, we'll export both the pure HTML function and a default
-- | handle from this module.

-- | Our follow button will have behavior that depends on the author we are interacting with. 
-- | Since the author's type already includes information about whether we follow this author, we 
-- | can use that to control the behavior of this HTML with the author type and some embedded 
-- | queries alone.

-- | In addition to this pure HTML renderer, however, we'd also like to supply the logic that will 
-- | work with the queries we've embedded. These two functions will take care of everything we need 
-- | in `eval` for a component which loads an author and then performs follow / unfollow actions 
-- | on it.
-- |
-- | In most cases I don't make assumptions about what is in state nor modify it, but in this case 
-- | I'm willing to adopt the convention that somewhere in state is an author that can be modified.
-- |
-- | The following two functions will handle safely making the request, logging errors, and updating 
-- | state with the result.

follow  
  :: forall s f g p o m
   . ManageUser m
  => Traversal' s Author
  -> H.HalogenM s f g p o m Unit
follow _author = act (eq NotFollowing <<< _.relation) followUser _author

unfollow  
  :: forall s f g p o m
   . ManageUser m
  => Traversal' s Author
  -> H.HalogenM s f g p o m Unit
unfollow _author = act (eq Following <<< _.relation) unfollowUser _author

-- | This will be kept internal, as it is only used to implement `follow` and `unfollow`.
