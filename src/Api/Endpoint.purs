-- | Conduit uses a REST API for resource management. This module defines endpoints in a data type
-- | which ensures invalid endpoints fail to compile. Since the library we use to perform requests
-- | uses string URLs, we need to be able to write our endpoints to string values. We'll use the
-- | `routing-duplex` library to get this string conversion for free.
-- |
-- | In a larger application we might code-generate this module from an Open API or Swagger 
-- | spec, or split it into several separate modules.
-- |
-- | This module takes the same approach as the `Conduit.Data.Route` module. For a more in-depth  
-- | treatment of representing endpoints and routes as a data type that can be parsed from and  
-- | printed to `String` values, I recommend reading the documentation in that module.

-- | First, let's define a few types necessary for our larger `Endpoint` type.

-- | Some endpoints are paginated and accept a limit (maximum count) and offset (number of items
-- | to skip over). Since some endpoints accept pagination in addition to other parameters, we'll
-- | create a row that can be shared by multiple types.
type PaginationRep =
  ( limit :: Maybe Int 
  , offset :: Maybe Int 
  )

-- | This record type is useful for endpoints that only need pagination information.
type Pagination = { | PaginationRep  }

-- | When we request articles we can include a few parameters to filter the results. Two of those
-- | parameters control pagination, so we'll re-use our pagination row defined above.
type ArticleParams =
  { tag :: Maybe String 
  , author :: Maybe Username 
  , favorited :: Maybe Username
  | PaginationRep 
  }

-- | It is annoying to have none or a single parameter and have to fill in all the others with 
-- | `Nothing` values. This value pre-fills all parameters with `Nothing` so you can update only 
-- | the ones you need. If the type ever gains new possible parameters, existing code written this
-- | way will continue to work.
-- | 
-- | ```purescript
-- | onlyTag = noArticleParams { tag = Just "tag" }
-- | ```
noArticleParams :: ArticleParams
noArticleParams =
  { tag: Nothing 
  , author: Nothing
  , favorited: Nothing 
  , offset: Nothing
  , limit: Nothing
  }

-- | This data type captures each endpoint our API supports. In a larger application this would be
-- | tedious to maintain, and it's more common to generate endpoints from a Swagger or Open API
-- | spec. For the time being, though, we'll take the same approach as we did for our routes and
-- | create an encompassing sum type to represent all endpoints. With this type, requests to 
-- | invalid endpoints (endpoints not captured in this type) will fail to compile.

-- Our codec will cause a compile-time error if we fail to handle any of our 
-- route cases.

-- | We need to be able to write our `Endpoint` type to a valid path in order to make requests. We
-- | can use `routing-duplex` the same way we did with our `Route` type to provide both a printer 
-- | (write to `String`) and a parser (parse from `String`) that stays in sync with our `Endpoint`
-- | type automatically.
-- | 
-- | For a full treatment of how this function produces both a parser and printer guaranteed to
-- | produce valid paths, see the `routing-duplex` tutorial:
