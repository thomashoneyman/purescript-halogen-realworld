-- | For now, our production app manages resources and fetches data using a REST API. This module
-- | defines several data types and helper functions to create and manage these requests. That
-- | includes managing auth tokens, designing types to represent possible requests, and more.
-- |
-- | While interesting, this module is largely mechanical. It helps provide most of the low-level
-- | functions that our production monad will leverage in `Conduit.AppM` to implement our various
-- | app capabilities.

-- | As usual, we'll start with types we'll use throughout this module.

-- | Conduit uses a REST API and secures certain endpoints using a JSON Web Token (JWT). That means
-- | most requests will use the token to attach an "Authorization" header. It's critical that this
-- | token is not inadvertently exposed and that we attach a correct token to requests. We can
-- | prevent the token from being changed and restrict the ways it can be created using the smart
-- | constructor pattern. To learn more about this pattern, see:
-- |
-- | https://thomashoneyman.com/guides/real-world-halogen/design-data-pure-functions/#restricting-the-domain-using-smart-constructors
-- |
-- | To achieve this, we'll create a newtype without exporting its constructor. That means that
-- | the only functions that will be able to access the string within the `Token` type are in
-- | this module (like `login` and `register`). We can be confident that a `Token` used outside
-- | this module was retrieved properly and hasn't been tampered with in the meantime.
newtype Token = Token String

-- | No `newtype` instance allowed! That would allow us to use the `wrap` and `unwrap` functions to
-- | access the string within the `Token` constructor.
derive instance eqToken :: Eq Token
derive instance ordToken :: Ord Token

-- | We won't derive a `Show` instance, either, because we don't ever want to reveal the token.
-- | Instead, we'll provide a manual instance.
instance showToken :: Show Token where
  show (Token _) = "Token {- token -}"

-- | Next, we'll give a meaningful type to the string that represents the base or root url of the
-- | application. In my opinion, we don't need to be nearly so strict about how this string is
-- | constructed, because we hard-code it once in `Main` and never touch it again. We could
-- | reasonably have used the smart constructor pattern, though.
newtype BaseURL = BaseURL String

-- | Next, we'll create a type to represent the different methods our API supports. An API request
-- | can be GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE. These methods are already captured by the `Data.HTTP.Method`
-- | module, but I've opted for a custom type because, in our API, only `Post` and `Put` can have
-- | optional JSON bodies. There should never be a `Get` request with a JSON body. This type
-- | prevents that from occurring.
data RequestMethod
  = Get
  | Post (Maybe Json)
  | Put (Maybe Json)
  | Delete

-- | The base url and token are necessary to make a request, but are low-level implementation
-- | details. When actually using the API, we generally worry about which endpoint we'd like to
-- | access and what request method we'd like to use.
-- |
-- | The `RequestOptions` type below relies on the `Endpoint` data type (which captures the possible
-- | API locations we can access) and the `RequestMethod` type we just defined (which describes how
-- | we access those endpoints).
-- |
-- | As a brief aside: even that information is too low-level for our business logic! In the
-- | rest of the application we'll use functions that work on the resources we're managing without
-- | caring about the implementation (REST, RPC, local files, mocks, etc.). This type will be
-- | used to write a REST implementation for our resource management capabilities.
-- |
-- | Check out the `Conduit.Capability.Resource.*` modules for examples of the high-level functions
-- | we'll use in our business logic.
type RequestOptions =
  { endpoint :: Endpoint
  , method :: RequestMethod
  }

-- | Let's bring these `BaseURL`, `Token`, and `RequestOptions` types together to create a data
-- | structure that the `Affjax` library understands and can use to make asynchronous requests.
-- | We won't use this function too often directly; it's instead used as a helper in all the
-- | request functions defined below and in the `Conduit.Api.Utils` modules.
defaultRequest :: BaseURL -> Maybe Token -> RequestOptions -> Request Json
defaultRequest (BaseURL baseUrl) auth { endpoint, method } =

-- | The following data types and functions aren't a natural fit for this module, but they've
-- | been included here because they operate on tokens. Remember: we can't create or manipulate
-- | the `Token` type outside this module, so we'll somewhat awkwardly define the registration
-- | and login requests in this module. These requests will be the only way to create an auth
-- | token in the system.
