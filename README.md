[PureScript](https://github.com/purescript) is a delightful purely-functional language that offers pragmatic and powerful tools to manage complexity and help you design, build, and refactor reliable apps of any size. This repository demonstrates the principles I apply at work every day in more than 2,000 lines of thoroughly commented code.

I’m a developer at [Awake Security](https://github.com/awakesecurity) (and previously at [CitizenNet](https://citizennet.com)). Both companies have large production PureScript applications that have remained reliable, understandable, and maintainable as they scale.

This repository follows the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec to implement a Medium clone called Conduit using [Halogen](https://github.com/purescript-halogen/purescript-halogen). It’s large enough to demonstrate real world examples (CRUD, state management, scalable architecture, type classes, components, etc.) but not so large as to be overwhelming.

The source code covers Halogen 6. This repository also covers previous versions of Halogen with the following resources:

- [The PR that migrated from Halogen 5 to Halogen 6](https://github.com/thomashoneyman/purescript-halogen-realworld/pull/82)
- [This application written using Halogen 5](https://github.com/thomashoneyman/purescript-halogen-realworld/tree/v2.0.0)
- [The PR that migrated from Halogen 4 to Halogen 5](https://github.com/thomashoneyman/purescript-halogen-realworld/pull/26)
- [This application written using Halogen 4](https://github.com/thomashoneyman/purescript-halogen-realworld/tree/v1.0.0)

## Installation

First, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/thomashoneyman/purescript-halogen-realworld
cd purescript-halogen-realworld
```

You can enter a development shell with all non-JavaScript dependencies via Nix:

```sh
nix-shell
```

> Alternately, you can install PureScript, Spago, and Zephyr manually. You can use NPM to install PureScript and Spago, and you can install the Zephyr binary [from its releases page](https://github.com/coot/zephyr/releases) -- ensure it exists in your PATH by moving it to `usr/bin/local`.

Next, install JavaScript dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

## Building and running

Next, build the project (this command will run `spago build`; see the [`package.json`](package.json) file to see
all helper scripts for the project):

```sh
npm run build
```

You can bundle the JS for production:

```sh
npm run bundle
```

And, once bundled, you can run a local server to use Conduit (defaults to [port 8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080), but if this port is already in use it will increment to 8081, etc.):

```sh
npm run serve-prod
```

## Dev mode

To run the application in dev mode, you can run the command below:

```sh
npm run serve-dev
```

When you reload the application in the browser, `esbuild` will re-bundle the application using the latest compiled PureScript in the `output` directory. If you're using the PureScript language server, then this directory will be updated when you save files via incremental compilation.

## Learning PureScript

This project is intended to give non-PureScript developers a taste of what a small application in the language looks like, and to give advanced beginners in PureScript a resource to feel comfortable building reliable applications of their own.

PureScript is a delightful language that becomes only more interesting and rewarding the more you use it and the larger your application becomes; if you haven’t yet tried it out, I encourage you to do so. Not convinced? [Kris Jenkins has a lovely talk about PureScript which might change your mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=22&v=5AtyWgQ3vv0).

### Resources

The PureScript community is overwhelmingly warm and helpful. If you would like some help getting started, please consider joining the [official Discourse](https://discourse.purescript.org) and [functional programming Slack](https://functionalprogramming.slack.com) ([invite link](https://fpchat-invite.herokuapp.com)). You may also want to check out:

1. [PureScript by Example](https://github.com/dwhitney/purescript-book), which will teach you PureScript from scratch and was written by the language’s creator, Phil Freeman. While the official book has not been updated for the latest version of the compiler, this link is to an up-to-date fork of the book.
2. Jordan Martinez’s [PureScript reference](https://github.com/JordanMartinez/purescript-jordans-reference), which has a broad overview of dozens of topics in PureScript and functional programming.
3. The (warning: currently in rough draft form) [handbook which explains the theory & principles at work in this application in-depth](https://thomashoneyman.com/guides/real-world-halogen), which will be useful to help take you from advanced beginner to advanced intermediate in the language.
4. The [official Halogen guide](https://github.com/slamdata/purescript-halogen), which will teach you how to use the Halogen framework to write components.

## Contributing

PRs are welcome! Any functional changes will need to remain compliant with the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec, and I may re-word documentation changes to fit with the voice used throughout the repository.
